# Code of conduct

Topics of discussion are expected to be constrained such that all discussion is relevant to the following goals:

- Maintaining `better-sqlite3`'s code, documentation, and build artifacts
- Helping people *get started* in using `better-sqlite3` within their software projects

Other areas of discussion are considered to be off-topic, including but not limited to:

- Politics
- Name-calling, insults
- Help with using SQLite (there's already [very good documentation](https://sqlite.org/docs.html) for that)
- Help with application architecture, and other high-level decisions about software projects
- Attention to personal traits such as race, gender, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, etc.

Repeated offenses against this code of conduct may result in being temporarily banned from the community. Unofficially, the community is expected to maintain a manner of professionalism and to treat others with respect.

Attempting to physically seize, sabotage, or distribute malware through `better-sqlite3` will result in being permanently banned from the community, without warning.
